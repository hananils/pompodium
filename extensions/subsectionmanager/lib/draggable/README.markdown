## Installation

This jQuery plugin for the Symphony backend which can be used by extension developers. Please include a copy inside your extension, e. g. `lib/draggable/symphony.draggable.js`. You can call it using the `addScriptToHead()` function:

	Administration::instance()->Page->addScriptToHead(URL . '/extensions/yourextension/lib/draggable/symphony.draggable.js', 101, false);

The third argument (`false`) makes sure that it is only added to the page head if it has not been added before (by another extension or another instance of your own extension for example).

		items:				'li',			// What children do we use as items? 
		handles:			'*',			// What children do we use as handles? If set to false, items will be used as handles.
		droppables:			'textarea',		// What elements do we use for dropping items?
		droppable:			true,			// Can items be dropped?
		sortable:			true,			// Can items be sorted?
		click:				jQuery.noop(),	// Function to be executed on click
		radius:				3,				// Click radius.
