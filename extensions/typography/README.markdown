## Synopsis

Improve your web typography with: hyphenation, space control, intelligent character replacement, and CSS hooks. This text formatter allows you to choose from the following text formatting languages:

* Plain HTML
* Markdown
* Markdown Extra
* Textile

The formatted text is then run through the [PHP Typography][] library. This extension is a spiritual successor to my old "Typogrify" extension - the two shouldn't be used together, and this extension is likely to produce better results.
